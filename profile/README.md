# About Texas A&M Formula Electric Team

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the **Texas A&M Formula Electric Team**! We are a dedicated group of students from Texas A&M University, working together to design, build, and compete with a fully electric race car in the Formula Electric racing series. Our team is composed of individuals from various disciplines including engineering, business, and design, united by a passion for motorsports, innovation, and sustainable technology.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to develop cutting-edge electric vehicle technology that not only competes at the highest levels but also inspires future engineers to push the boundaries of innovation in the field of electric mobility. Through collaboration, hands-on learning, and real-world problem solving, we aim to create an environment where students can thrive in both technical and professional growth.

## Our Purpose
The purpose of Texas A&M Formula Electric is to cultivate students into high-quality engineers through the full-scale development of a high-performing electric formula style vehicle and through year-over-year improvement of the program. 

## About Our Car
The Formula Electric car we develop is designed to compete in various electric racing competitions. It is engineered with cutting-edge technologies in areas like:
- Powertrain and battery management systems
- Aerodynamics and vehicle dynamics
- Data acquisition and telemetry
- Chassis design and manufacturing

Our goal is to push the boundaries of performance while ensuring the vehicle is safe, reliable, and as energy-efficient as possible.

## Get Involved
We welcome students from all backgrounds to join us in our mission. Whether you are interested in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, software development, marketing, or business management, there is a place for you on our team. We look for individuals who are passionate about innovation, teamwork, and sustainability.
